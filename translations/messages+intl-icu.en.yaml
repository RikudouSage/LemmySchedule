app.post.expressions.date_inject.description: |
  Makes it possible to inject the date **at the time of the post**. Very useful for recurring posts. The `date-string` parameter must be filled with a string from the PHP's [DateTime::format()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.format.php#refsect1-datetime.format-parameters) method.
  Some examples:
  
  - `{example1}`: *{result1}*
  - `{example2}`: *{result2}*
  - `{example3}`: *{result3}*
app.post.expressions.counter.description: |
  Increments a named counter every time you make a post which includes it. See [Counters]({countersUrl}) to list all your counters or create new ones.
  Useful for recurring posts which are not related, for example `{example}` could be used for a weekly post that increments indefinitely and is not dependent
  on the date.
